# Car Loan Payment Calculator

A **Java console application** that calculates the estimated monthly payment for a car loan.  
This project demonstrates **object-oriented programming fundamentals** such as variables, conditionals, and arithmetic operations.

## Features
Takes input for:
  - Loan amount  
  - Loan length (in years)
